## Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

## **Image Description**

![](EpiTriad.png)

In all situations where an organism is infected, there is a combination of factors that led up to and are currently influencing the infection. All of these factors fall under or in between the headings of host, pathogen, and environment. The image shown above is the epidemiological triad, a figure that displays the interrelationship that exists between host(s), pathogen(s), and a given environment. By using an image to depict the relationships, it is easier to visualize, determine how an infection occurred, and take steps to treat/control it.

## Sample Size Table

![](ss_table.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    [The necessary sample size from a population of 5000 deer to detect a disease at 5% prevalence with 95% confidence is 59 deer.]{.underline}

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

    a\. 95% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population.

    b\. 99% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population:

    [The sample size requirement will be higher in the scenario where the prevalence is lower. This is likely due to the inverse relationship between prevalence and sample size, which appears to be a stronger relationship than the direct relationship between confidence interval and sample size.]{.underline}

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \<1 %.

Prevalence and Incidence

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

![](images/clipboard-2131967091.png)

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

Show your work.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. *Write the unit for incidence.* (9 points)

[6/12: (5 new cases/51 susceptible elk)\* 100 = 9.80 cases per elk-day.]{.underline}

[6/14: (2 new cases/44 susceptible elk)\* 100 = 4.34 cases per elk-day.]{.underline}

# Tick Identification Lab

During the tick identification lab, Bella walked us through applying what she discussed with us on Monday's lecture. We looked at the number of legs the specimens had, 6 if it was a larvae and 8 if it was a nymph or adult. If 8 legs were seen, we would also look for the presence of a genital pore, which nymphs lack, to differentiate between the two life cycle stages. Following this, we could examine the position of the anal groove, anterior or posterior, to discern whether the tick is genus *Ixodes* or not. Finally, the tick can be turned over to allow for determination of the presence of an alloscutum if male or consutum if female. While determine whether an alloscutum or conscutum is present, we were also able to examine the mouth parts and compare them to a dichotomous to further confirm what tick we had found. Being able to identify which tick(s) have been collected during a sampling will allow for resources to be allocated to raising awareness about and increasing surveillance of the diseases vectored by those ticks. Climbing global temperatures and increased urbanization of previously wild areas has substantially increased the risk that humans and their pets become incidental hosts during the life cycle of these ticks, contracting a tickborne disease as a result. This is especially concerning due to ticks being able to maintain coinfections, allowing them to spread more than one disease in an area and is supported by the increasing incidence of tickborne diseases. Also, with the ability of transstadial transmission, a tick can easily contract a pathogen as a larvae and be transported to a new area miles away as it progresses towards adulthood, bringing the pathogen to an area where it is potentially epizootic.

# Test 1 Corrections

Question: Compare and contrast the two measures of frequency of disease: Prevalence and Incidence

Answer: Both incidence and prevalence examine the frequency with which a disease occurs and its morbidity within a population. Both provide an idea of how a disease is affecting the population. Incidence only considers new cases of the infection, while prevalence considers past and present cases. Also, incidence only considers members of the population that are still susceptible, while prevalence considers the entire population - susceptible, infected, or recovered. Finally, incidence allows for risk of being infected to be determined, while prevalence allows for the number of individuals likely to be infected in populations of various sizes (ex: 1000, 10000, 100000 individuals).

Question: When is the prevalence lowest? When is prevalence highest? Write the unit for prevalence if applicable.

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

Distribution of confirmed cases of MERS by place of infection and month of onset, April 2012 – September 2025 (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control)

![](MERS%20Epi%20Curve.png){width="699"}

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? *(If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)*

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)

[This statement is incorrect. Due to transmission of MERS through human-to-human contact being limited, MERS would be unable to successfully maintained in the human population.]{.underline}

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

[This statement is correct]{.underline}.

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

[This statement is correct]{.underline}.

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)

[This statement is incorrect. The case fatality rate would be 35% because this is the percentage of infected individuals out of the total number of infected individuals that died as a result of MERS-CoV.]{.underline}

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)

    [This statement is incorrect. The epidemic curve indicates that MERS-CoV is the result of continuous source exposure, due to the waves of cases that are occurring. The continuous source is likely from camels that are in close contact with humans, leading to multiple spillover events.]{.underline}

# Worksheet 5

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024**

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units. ​

​1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

I would classify it as an emerging infectious disease. MDV has a low between species transmission rate, because outbreaks of MDV are not occurring constantly. Additionally, unlike with a typical spillover event, all of the outbreaks of MDV had a high within H2 transmission or would have if proper measures had not been taken to reduce transmission.

2\. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

Community settings: Educating communities about how MDV spreads, forming relationships that will encourage community members to come to the hospital if they suspect symptoms, encourage/incentivize reporting.

Healthcare settings: Access to PPE, Clear commitment to high quality healthcare, keeping up to date on new technologies that could be used to prevent the transmission of MDV, having local healthcare workers lead disease prevention and treatment responses.
