## Find area of a circle with radius 5 cm.

Formula: ¶ \* r\^2

where r is the radius.

```{r}
# Function to calculate the area of a circle
area_of_circle <- function(radius) {
  area <- pi * radius^2
  return(area)
}
radius <- 5 # from the example
circle_area <- area_of_circle(radius)
cat("The area of the circle with radius", radius, "is", circle_area, "\n")
```

## **Image Description**

![](EpiTriad.png)

In all situations where an organism is infected, there is a combination of factors that led up to and are currently influencing the infection. All of these factors fall under or in between the headings of host, pathogen, and environment. The image shown above is the epidemiological triad, a figure that displays the interrelationship that exists between host(s), pathogen(s), and a given environment. By using an image to depict the relationships, it is easier to visualize, determine how an infection occurred, and take steps to treat/control it.

## Sample Size Table

![](ss_table.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    [The necessary sample size from a population of 5000 deer to detect a disease at 5% prevalence with 95% confidence is 59 deer.]{.underline}

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

    a\. 95% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population.

    b\. 99% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population:

    [The sample size requirement will be higher in the scenario where the prevalence is lower. This is likely due to the inverse relationship between prevalence and sample size, which appears to be a stronger relationship than the direct relationship between confidence interval and sample size.]{.underline}

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \<1 %.

Prevalence and Incidence

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

![](images/clipboard-2131967091.png)

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

Show your work.

a\) Find incidence on day 06/12/25, 06/14/25 and 06/15/25. *Write the unit for incidence.* (9 points)

[6/12: (5 new cases/51 susceptible elk)\* 100 = 9.80 cases per elk-day.]{.underline}

[6/14: (2 new cases/44 susceptible elk)\* 100 = 4.34 cases per elk-day.]{.underline}

[6/15: (0 new cases/44 susceptible elk) \*100 = 0 cases per elk-day.]{.underline}

b\) What is the prevalence of conjunctivitis on 06/13/25 and 06/16/25? What is the unit for prevalence.   (5 points)

[6/13: (12 infected/56 total in herd) \* 100 = 21.43% cases per 100 elk.]{.underline}

[6/16: (5/56) \* 100 = 8.93 cases per 100 elk.]{.underline}

c\) On which day is the prevalence same as the incidence (except the units)? (3 points)

[The prevalence and incidence were the same on 6/10/25.]{.underline}

d\) On which day is the incidence lowest? (3 points)

[Incidence is lowest on 6/15/25.]{.underline}

# Tick Identification Lab

During the tick identification lab, Bella walked us through applying what she discussed with us on Monday's lecture. We looked at the number of legs the specimens had, 6 if it was a larvae and 8 if it was a nymph or adult. If 8 legs were seen, we would also look for the presence of a genital pore, which nymphs lack, to differentiate between the two life cycle stages. Following this, we could examine the position of the anal groove, anterior or posterior, to discern whether the tick is genus *Ixodes* or not. Finally, the tick can be turned over to allow for determination of the presence of an alloscutum if male or consutum if female. While determine whether an alloscutum or conscutum is present, we were also able to examine the mouth parts and compare them to a dichotomous to further confirm what tick we had found. Being able to identify which tick(s) have been collected during a sampling will allow for resources to be allocated to raising awareness about and increasing surveillance of the diseases vectored by those ticks. Climbing global temperatures and increased urbanization of previously wild areas has substantially increased the risk that humans and their pets become incidental hosts during the life cycle of these ticks, contracting a tickborne disease as a result. This is especially concerning due to ticks being able to maintain coinfections, allowing them to spread more than one disease in an area and is supported by the increasing incidence of tickborne diseases. Also, with the ability of transstadial transmission, a tick can easily contract a pathogen as a larvae and be transported to a new area miles away as it progresses towards adulthood, bringing the pathogen to an area where it is potentially epizootic.

# Test 1 Corrections

Question: Compare and contrast the two measures of frequency of disease: Prevalence and Incidence

Answer: Both incidence and prevalence examine the frequency with which a disease occurs and its morbidity within a population. Both provide an idea of how a disease is affecting the population. Incidence only considers new cases of the infection, while prevalence considers past and present cases. Also, incidence only considers members of the population that are still susceptible, while prevalence considers the entire population - susceptible, infected, or recovered. Finally, incidence allows for risk of being infected to be determined, while prevalence allows for the number of individuals likely to be infected in populations of various sizes (ex: 1000, 10000, 100000 individuals).

Question: When is the prevalence lowest? When is prevalence highest? Write the unit for prevalence if applicable.
