## **Image Description**

![](EpiTriad.png)

In all situations where an organism is infected, there is a combination of factors that led up to and are currently influencing the infection. All of these factors fall under or in between the headings of host, pathogen, and environment. The image shown above is the epidemiological triad, a figure that displays the interrelationship that exists between host(s), pathogen(s), and a given environment. By using an image to depict the relationships, it is easier to visualize, determine how an infection occurred, and take steps to treat/control it.

## Sample Size Table

![](ss_table.png){fig-align="center"}

1.  Find the sample size necessary to detect a disease at or above 5% prevalence in a herd of 5000 deer. The desired level of confidence is 95%.

    [The necessary sample size from a population of 5000 deer to detect a disease at 5% prevalence with 95% confidence is 59 deer.]{.underline}

2.  Using the hypergeometric distribution, compare the sample size requirements for the following scenarios:

    a\. 95% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 1% prevalence in a large population.

    b\. 99% confidence interval in detecting a disease at 2% prevalence in a large population:

    [The sample size requirement will be higher in the scenario where the prevalence is lower. This is likely due to the inverse relationship between prevalence and sample size, which appears to be a stronger relationship than the direct relationship between confidence interval and sample size.]{.underline}

3.  You sample 300 deer from a high-fenced facility that has a herd of 4000. None of the 300 deer have antibodies against Epizootic Hemorrhagic Disease. Based on this finding, you are 95% confident that the prevalence of exposure to EHD in this facility is \<1 %.

Prevalence and Incidence

Jan’s research focused on an elk herd housed in an exclosure. The herd size is 56. Her data shows that an outbreak of conjunctivitis started on 10^th^ June 2025. She meticulously documented the progress of the outbreak in this herd. Her observations of affected elk are as follows:

![](images/clipboard-2131967091.png)

Recovered elk are immune (not susceptible) to conjunctivitis for 6 months. There were no infected elk in the herd after 06/16/25.

# Tick Identification Lab

During the tick identification lab, Bella walked us through applying what she discussed with us on Monday's lecture. We looked at the number of legs the specimens had, 6 if it was a larvae and 8 if it was a nymph or adult. If 8 legs were seen, we would also look for the presence of a genital pore, which nymphs lack, to differentiate between the two life cycle stages. Following this, we could examine the position of the anal groove, anterior or posterior, to discern whether the tick is genus *Ixodes* or not. Finally, the tick can be turned over to allow for determination of the presence of an alloscutum if male or consutum if female. While determine whether an alloscutum or conscutum is present, we were also able to examine the mouth parts and compare them to a dichotomous to further confirm what tick we had found. Being able to identify which tick(s) have been collected during a sampling will allow for resources to be allocated to raising awareness about and increasing surveillance of the diseases vectored by those ticks. Climbing global temperatures and increased urbanization of previously wild areas has substantially increased the risk that humans and their pets become incidental hosts during the life cycle of these ticks, contracting a tickborne disease as a result. This is especially concerning due to ticks being able to maintain coinfections, allowing them to spread more than one disease in an area and is supported by the increasing incidence of tickborne diseases. Also, with the ability of transstadial transmission, a tick can easily contract a pathogen as a larvae and be transported to a new area miles away as it progresses towards adulthood, bringing the pathogen to an area where it is potentially epizootic.

# Test 1 Corrections

Question: Compare and contrast the two measures of frequency of disease: Prevalence and Incidence

Answer: Both incidence and prevalence examine the frequency with which a disease occurs and its morbidity within a population. Both provide an idea of how a disease is affecting the population. Incidence only considers new cases of the infection, while prevalence considers past and present cases. Also, incidence only considers members of the population that are still susceptible, while prevalence considers the entire population - susceptible, infected, or recovered. Finally, incidence allows for risk of being infected to be determined, while prevalence allows for the number of individuals likely to be infected in populations of various sizes (ex: 1000, 10000, 100000 individuals).

Question: When is the prevalence lowest? When is prevalence highest? Write the unit for prevalence if applicable.

**MERS-CoV**

Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is mostly found in camels (dromedaries), and direct physical contact with camels can lead to transmission to humans. Limited human-to-human transmission can occur after close contact and has resulted in health care–associated outbreaks. Human MERS-CoV infection can cause severe respiratory illness; approximately 35% of reported MERS cases have died.

![](MERS%20Epi%20Curve.png){width="699"}

Which of the following statements about MERS-CoV are correct? *(If it is incorrect, provide an explanation why the statement is incorrect.)*

1.  MERS-CoV is primarily maintained in human populations. (2 points)

[This statement is incorrect. Due to transmission of MERS through human-to-human contact being limited, MERS would be unable to successfully maintained in the human population.]{.underline}

2.  Camels serve as the main animal reservoir for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

[This statement is correct]{.underline}.

3.  Humans are dead-end hosts for MERS-CoV. (2 points)

[This statement is correct]{.underline}.

4.  The estimated case fatality rate for human MERS-CoV infections is approximately 65%. (2 points)

[This statement is incorrect. The case fatality rate would be 35% because this is the percentage of infected individuals out of the total number of infected individuals that died as a result of MERS-CoV.]{.underline}

5.  The epidemic curve indicates this is a point source outbreak. (2 points)

    [This statement is incorrect. The epidemic curve indicates that MERS-CoV is the result of continuous source exposure, due to the waves of cases that are occurring. The continuous source is likely from camels that are in close contact with humans, leading to multiple spillover events.]{.underline}

**Marburg Virus Outbreak, Rwanda 2024**

The first person to become infected in the current Marburg virus outbreak in Rwanda probably contracted the disease during a visit to a cave with Egyptian rousette bats/fruit bats that are known reservoir of Marburg virus. As of 19 December 2024, 66 cases of Marburg virus infection were documented, and most of the people infected were health care workers, mainly those who worked in intensive care units. ​

​1. Using the community epidemiology framework developed by Fenton and Pedersen, would you classify this Marburg virus outbreak as a spillover event or an emerging infectious disease? Justify your classification.

I would classify it as an emerging infectious disease. MDV has a low between species transmission rate, because outbreaks of MDV are not occurring constantly. Additionally, unlike with a typical spillover event, all of the outbreaks of MDV had a high within H2 transmission or would have if proper measures had not been taken to reduce transmission.

2\. What measures could be implemented to reduce the risk of transmission in both community and healthcare settings?

Community settings: Educating communities about how MDV spreads, forming relationships that will encourage community members to come to the hospital if they suspect symptoms, encourage/incentivize reporting.

Healthcare settings: Access to PPE, Clear commitment to high quality healthcare, keeping up to date on new technologies that could be used to prevent the transmission of MDV, having local healthcare workers lead disease prevention and treatment responses.

Graduate Presentations Set 1

Nipah Virus\
Nipah virus ecology varies across regions, resulting in distinct patterns of transmission\
in places like Malaysia and Bangladesh. Describe how the modes of transmission differ\
between these two regions and explain how these differences influence the preventive\
measures recommended in each setting. 8 points

In Malaysia, infected bats contaminate fruit, which is then dropped to the ground. The contaminated fruit is eaten by pigs, which then transmit it to swine herders. While in Bangladesh, the infected bats contaminate the basins used to collect date palm sap. When the date palm sap is consumed raw, the virus is passed to humans. The mode of transmission seen in Malaysia requires a bridge species, swine, while the Bangladesh pathway does not. In the Malaysia pathway, keeping swine away from fruit trees would be the simplest preventative measure. Additionally, educating swine herders on what evidence of bats in an area looks like would help them be able to take steps to avoid those areas or attempt to drive the bats from the area. In the Bangladesh pathway, placing lids on the basins or covering the basin in some way to help minimize contamination is a preventative measure that would preserve the selling of raw date palm sap. Another options is to heat up the date palm sap after collection, in order to kill the virus.

\
Avian Reovirus\
Avian reoviruses (ARV) can be transmitted through multiple routes. Describe the\
different transmission routes of ARV and explain which environmental factors favor its\
transmission. What pathogen characteristics support one of these transmission routes?\
Finally, provide an example of a wild bird disease caused by ARV and briefly describe\
its impact on the affected population. 6 points

ARV can be spread through either the fecal-oral route or vertically in-ovo. The fecal-oral route is supported by poor litter hygiene and contaminated food and water. These factors allow for fecal matter from potentially infected birds to easily build up, get into the food or water, and allow the virus to be passed to naive birds, as ARV can persist in the environment for weeks. The vertical route is supported by multi-age housing and overcrowding. These factors place sexual mature birds with sexually immature birds in a confined area that is already to small for all the birds, which increases the chance that a hen laying fertile eggs will be exposed to ARV and passes it to the chick. The pathogen characteristics of being resilient and environmentally stable lends to the success of the fecal-oral route. ARV is the cause of winter mortality in crows, in which the crows suffer from neurological and respiratory signs, ultimately leading to their deaths.

\
Langya henipavirus\
Langya henipavirus (LayV) is an emerging zoonotic virus first identified in China.\
Describe the likely reservoir and transmission route of Langya virus. Why is LayV\
classified as a spillover and not a potential EID? 6 points

[The likely reservoir of LayV is shrews as they were the animal with the highest prevalence of those animals tested for the presence of LayV or LayV antibodies. The likely route of transmission is through coming in contact with the shrews directly or indirectly. Direct contact would likely be through handling them Indirect transmission would be through handling fomites, whether it be contaminated produce or handling soil that shrews live in due to the stability of LayV in the environment.]{.underline}

[LayV is classified as a spillover because there is low within species transmission, as the prevalence level in the tested shrews was only 27%, and the fact that there have been very few human cases. Additionally, in the human cases, no human-human transmission was seen.]{.underline}

*B.procyonis* data analysis

The dataset is comprised of information collected on 61 raccoons, each of which was necropsied and the number of roundworms counted. For each host there is data on the date of capture, the region (North, Central and South), the sex (male, female) and the age (adult, young adult). The last column gives the number of worms found during necropsy. Zero (0) worms indicates the raccoon was not found to be infected. Note that the necropsy data is real.

\
You have to analyze and summarize this data. Identify the patterns that emerge and\
use the available data to explain the patterns. For example, you can compare\
prevalence of B. procyonis between the three regions, between males and females in\
each region, between age classes in each region, etc.

Please show your work, use Quantitative Parasitology for your calculations and comparisons. Provide confidence intervals for prevalence estimates.

Finally, explain your analysis of this real-world data.

The total prevalence of raccoon roundworm in Arkansas could be estimated to be around \~43%, based on the collected data. Adults showed a higher prevalence in comparison to young adults, in addition to more adults overall being infected. This could be a result of adults having had more time to acquire an infection than young adults. There is no statistically significant relationship between the prevalence values of the adult and young adult groups. When comparing males and females, females were found to have a higher prevalence. The relationship between the prevalences was found to be statistically significant, establishing a non-random relationship between males and females. Between the North, South, and Central regions, the Central region had the highest prevalence. However, the Central region also had the least number of raccoons collected from it, likely leading to the prevalence appearing higher than it truly is if a greater number of raccoons were collected. Also, the South region has almost the same prevalence level with many more raccoons collected, pointing to the South region being the hot spot for raccoon roundworm in Arkansas. When comparing the prevalence values for the 3 regions to one another, a statistically significant relationship was found between the prevalence values for the North and South regions as well as the North and Central regions. This means that the relationship between the two groups in both cases is non-random.

When looking at the trends for the sexes within a region and between regions, some interesting trends emerged. For example, there is a 100% prevalence of *Baylisascaris procyonis* in females in both the South and Central regions. This points to females being the source of the infection for both regions, despite being outnumbered by the males. The region with the highest prevalence was the South, with the collected males showing 50% prevalence and females showing 100% prevalence. The region with the lowest prevalence was the North, with the collected males showing 24.1% prevalence and females showing 38.1% prevalence. The prevalence values for the Central region are between those seen in the North and South regions. Therefore, it is likely that the further north in the state a raccoon is, the less likely it is to be infected by *Baylisascaris procyonis*. When comparing the results for the sexes between regions, there was found to be a significant relationship between the following pairs: South female and male, North female and South female, North female and Central female, and North male and South male. This suggests that the prevalence between South and Central females with North females is non-random, perhaps pointing to relocation by humans or migration of females from the North to the other two regions. This thought is further supported by the established significant relationship between South and North males, suggesting that breeding pairs may have been moved to the South.
